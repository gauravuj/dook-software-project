## What is Dook?

An _elegant, minimalistic and intuitive_ **desktop application** made especially for [**NUS Computing students**](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) to
easily manage their academic **consultations** and **contacts** all-in-one place.

Dook blends the power of a nimble [**Command Line Interface (CLI)**](#glossary) together with the intuitive accessibility of a
[**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**](#glossary).

Designed for the dynamic needs of the NUS
School of Computing (SoC) community, Dook centralizes faculty information
in an innovative manner, allowing one to easily find their professors by taking advantage of the basic CLI familiarity of SoC students.

For the **quick typist**, Dook elevates your ability to swiftly organize your academic consultations with professors
and teaching assistants, outpacing conventional GUI-based applications, making management of consultations a breeze.

We hope that you will find this guide helpful in maximising your Dook experience! :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have [Java 11](#faq) or above installed in your Computer. If you have never downloaded it before,
   download from [here.](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html)

1. Download the latest version of [Dook](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/releases) `jar` in your computer.

1. Copy the file into an empty folder you want to use as the `home folder` for Dook.

1. Depending on your operating system, either open “Terminal” on macOS or “Command Prompt” in Windows, and type `java -jar Dook.jar` to run the application. <br>
   
You should see a GUI similar to the one shown below pop up in a few seconds.
**Note** that the application doesn't have any sample data.

   ![Ui image](images/SampleUi.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Information**

New to the command line? Don't worry, checkout this [guide](https://tutorials.codebar.io/command-line/introduction/tutorial.html)
</div>

### Let's add some sample data

1. First, go to the [command box](#understanding-the-interface) on the main window, where it says 
   _"Enter Command here..."_
2. Now, type `help` to open another window that lists out all the **commands** native to Dook.
3. Next, paste this command to add a **contact** named `Bob Smith` to the Dook address book. `add -n Bob Smith -p 98765432 -e bsmith@example.com -a Bedok 693021`
4. Now, let's add some sample **consultations**. Paste this in your [command box](#understanding-the-interface) to add a consultation named `CS2103T Consultation`. <br>`book -n CS2103T Consultation -s 2024-04-21 14:00 -e 2024-04-21 16:00`
5. Repeat steps 3 - 4 to add some more sample data, however this time **change** the details after each flag. (for example, `add -n Celine -p 98564383 ...`) 
6. Now, let's **find** a consultation by typing `search CS2103T Consultation` into the `command box`
7. Voila! You did it. You finally added some sample data to Dook and tried some native features as well.
8. Now, let's exit the app using `exit` command. Don't worry, you data is **automatically saved** to Dook Address Book.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add -n NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add -n John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `-n NAME [-t TAG]` can be used as `-n John Doe -t friend` or as `-n John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[-t TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `-t friend`, `-t friend -t family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `-n NAME -p PHONE_NUMBER`, `-p PHONE_NUMBER -n NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Contact Management

#### Adding a contact: `add`

**Situation:** With every contact book, we need to be able to create contacts. You have just made a new friend in your tutorial and
decided to save his contact for future collaboration purposes.

```
add -n NAME [-p PHONE_NUMBER] [-e EMAIL] [-a ADDRESS] [-t TAG…​]
```


| Param            | Remarks                                                                                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **NAME**         | Must be non-null and unique                                                                                    |
| **PHONE_NUMBER** | Optional, only numbers and minimum 3 digits                                                                    |
| **EMAIL**        | Optional, follow standard email formats (i.e xxx@xxx)                                                          |
| **ADDRESS**      | Optional                                                                                                       |
| **TAG**          | Optional, each tag should start with -t (i.e. for two tags `friend`, `groupmate` use `-t friend -t groupmate`) |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">
:exclamation: **Note** <br>

Currently, Dook doesn't have the ability to recognise abbreviations (with a forward slash) such as d/o or s/o in the **_NAME_** parameter, so 
it might return an error.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**

A person can have any number of tags (including 0)
</div>

For example:
* `add -n John Doe -p 98765432 -e johnd@example.com -a John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add -n Betsy Crowe -t friend -e betsycrowe@example.com -a Newgate Prison -p 1234567 -t criminal`

Below shows the successful output upon executing `add` command:

![Success Add Command](images/AddCommandSucess.png)

Below shows the contact list upon successful adding of contact:

![Success Add Command Contact](images/AddCommandContactsSuccess.png)

In the event that the command entered is **invalid**, the below error message will be shown:

![Invalid Add Command Contact](images/AddCommandInvalid.png)

In the event that there is an **existing user** in the contact book, the below error message will be shown:

![Duplicate Add Command Contact](images/AddCommandDuplicate.png)

#### Adding a Professor

**Situation:** You have just taken CS2040S and you now have a favorite Professor in SoC! You would like to stay in contact with them and have their updated contact details at
your fingertips.

To add a specific Professor to the Dook,

```
prof -n NAME
```

| Param            | Remarks                                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **NAME**         | Must be non-null and unique (and must be from NUS SoC) |

Examples:
* `prof -n aaron`

![Prof Aaron Contact](images/profaaron.png)

You can also easily add all SoC staff faculty to Dook with one command:

```
prof -a
```


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">
:exclamation: **Warning** <br>

While adding all professors is included as feature, we generally advise against this. You might find adding professors individually more useful unless you decide
having the whole SoC staff faculty in your contact book is necessary!

</div>

#### Listing all contacts : `list`

**Situation:** You decided one day to touch base with all your course-mates and friends in NUS.

This command lets you easily view all the people in your contacts!

Format: `list`

Below shows the successful output upon executing `list`:

![List Command Success](images/ListCommandSuccess.png)

Below shows the contact list upon executing `list`:

![List Command Contact Success](images/ListCommandContacts.png)

#### Editing a contact : `edit`

**Situation:** You just had a catchup with an old friend and realised he changed his phone number because after
migrating overseas.

The command allows you to update an existing contact's details.

```
edit INDEX [-n NAME] [-p PHONE] [-e EMAIL] [-a ADDRESS] [-t TAG]…​
```

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* **At least one** of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e. adding of tags is **not** cumulative.

| Param            | Remarks                                                                                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **INDEX**        | Must be an integer in the range [1, number of contacts displayed]                                              |
| **NAME**         | Optional                                                                                                       |
| **PHONE_NUMBER** | Optional, only numbers and minimum 3 digits                                                                    |
| **EMAIL**        | Optional, follow standard email formats (i.e xxx@xxx)                                                          |
| **ADDRESS**      | Optional                                                                                                       |
| **TAG**          | Optional, each tag should start with -t (i.e. for two tags `friend`, `groupmate` use `-t friend -t groupmate`) |

Examples:
* `edit 1 -p 91234567 -e johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 -n Betsy Crower -t` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

Here is the current state of a contact information before updating:

![Success Add Command Contact](images/AddCommandContactsSuccess.png)

Upon executing the command `edit 1 -n John Lim -p 23456789 -a 311, Rochor Ave 1, #01-01, johnl@example.com -t friend`,
below would be the expected output:

![Success Edit Command](images/EditCommandSuccess.png)

Here is the updated state of the contact information after updating:

![Success Edit Command Contact](images/EditCommandContactsSuccess.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Information**

When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">:bulb: **Tip:**

You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `-t` without specifying any tags after it.

</div>

#### Locating contacts by name: `find`

Imagine you have just met a wonderful group of NUS students at a networking event, and you've added their details to the
contact book. A few days later, you want to send a follow-up email to one of them, but their name escapes you. You remember
it started with "John"

This command allows you to quickly retrieve all names that match, ensuring you can maintain that crucial connection without
a hitch.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Information**

For now, we can only `find` contacts by name - future implementations would include finding by other fields as well,
so stay tuned!
</div>

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>

Below shows all the current contacts in our contact list, say we have 3 contacts, `John Doe`, `Peter Doe` and `Sarah Jacobs`:

![List Command Contact Success](images/ListCommandContacts.png)

Say we only want contacts with "John" in our contact list, we shall execute `find John` to achieve this.

Below shows the expected output after running the command, there is only 1 contact with `John` in their name:

![Find Command Success](images/FindCommandSuccess.png)

Below shows the expected contact list after running the command:

![Find Command Contact Success](images/FindCommandContactsSuccess.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Information**

This command will also fetch all existing Professors in the contact book if there is a match!

</div>

#### Deleting a contact : `delete`

Your contact book is starting to look cluttered, and you realise you no longer certain contacts' details.

This command deletes the specified person from the contact book, ensuring your contacts remain relevant and up-to-date.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index **must be a positive number** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.

Below shows the current state of our contact list:

![Delete Command Contacts Before](images/DeleteCommandContactsBefore.png)

Say we want to remove `Sarah Jacobs` from our contact list, as she migrated overseas to pursue her masters, and we lost contact.
We observe that she is index number **3** in our contact list. As such, we will run `delete 3` in our command box.

Below is the expected output after running `delete 3`:

![Delete Command Success](images/DeleteCommandSuccess.png)

Below is the expected contact list after running `delete 3`, we observe `Sarah Jacobs` no longer exists in our contact list.

![Delete Command Contacts Success](images/DeleteCommandContactsSuccess.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
:bulb: **Tips**

`find John` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person with the name `John`.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

**:exclamation: Destructive Command!**<br>

This command is **irreversible**, the deleted contact information will be lost!

</div>


### Booking Management

#### Adding a booking : `book`

If you want to remind yourself of your consult tomorrow, you can add it to Dook.

```
book -n DESCRIPTION -s START_TIME -e END_TIME -note NOTE
```
* Duplicate bookings are not allowed! This means that across two bookings, you cannot have all four params to be the exact same.
* For now: start and end time formats must be in `yyyy-mm-d hh:mm` (we are working to expand this!)

| Param           | Remarks                                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| **DESCRIPTION** | Must be non-null and unique              |
| **START_TIME**  | Must follow format of `2023-12-31 19:00` |
| **END_TIME**    | Must follow format of `2023-12-31 19:00` |
| **NOTE**        | Must be non-null                         |

Examples:
* `book -n CS2101 Consult -s 2023-12-31 19:00 -e 2023-12-31 23:00 -note DO HOMEWORK`

#### Updating bookings: `update`

Did the meeting date change? Or perhaps you want to add extra reminders in the notes? Try:
```
update INDEX -n {description} -s {start_time} -e {end_time} -note {note}
```
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed booking list.
* Other params are optional and entered only if you want to update current data.

| Param           | Remarks                                            |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **INDEX**       | Refers to currently displayed bookings             |
| **DESCRIPTION** | Optional                                           |
| **START_TIME**  | Optional, Must follow format of `2023-12-31 19:00` |
| **END_TIME**    | Optional, Must follow format of `2023-12-31 19:00` |
| **NOTE**        | Optional                                           |


#### Cancelling a booking : `cancel`

Did an appointment get cancelled or postponed? You can easily cancel bookings from the address book using:

```
cancel INDEX
```

* Deletes the booking at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed booking list.

Examples:
* `cancel 2` cancels the 2nd booking shown in the booking list.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
:bulb: **Tips**

You might want to use [search](###-searching-for-a-booking) to display the booking in the GUI first to easily find its INDEX.
</div>

#### Searching for a booking : `search`

Have too many bookings? Worry not, as you can searche for specific bookings using:

```
search KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]
```

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `coNsUlT` will match `Consult`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `consult CS2103` will match `CS2103 Consult`
* Bookings matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Consult` will return `CS2103 Consult`, `CS5300 Consult`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
:bulb: **Tips**

Want to see all your bookings again? Try the [view command](###-searching-for-a-booking) .
</div>

#### Viewing all bookings : `view`
Done searching for your bookings with your favourite professor? Lets display all your bookings using:
```
view
```

#### Clearing all bookings entries : `cancel -a`

Want a fresh start? Quickly clears all your bookings with:

 ```
 cancel -a
 ```

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

**:exclamation: Be careful!**<br>

This command is **irreversible**, and all your data will be lost.
Please use this command with caution!

</div>

### Other features

####  Changing themes in Dook : `theme`

Dook comes preinstalled with a light and dark theme.

Format: `theme -bg THEME` 

* Changes the current theme to either dark, light or any other theme. 
* Dark theme is the *default* on a new launch
* Dook remembers your preferences, it loads the most recent selected theme on launch.

Examples:
* `theme -bg light`

Below shows the application **before** executing `theme -bg light`:

![Dark Theme](images/darktheme.png)

Below shows the application **after** executing `theme -bg light`:

![Light Theme](images/lighttheme.png)

Below shows the error message upon executing an invalid theme: 

![Theme_Command_Failure](images/themefailure.png)


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Information**

New themes are currently being added. In v1.5, we envisioned to create a tool for users to create their own theme from the
`command box` itself.

#### Adding aliases in Dook : `alias`

For commands that you use often, Dook allows the aliasing of them to any input of your choice.

```
-al NEW_COMMAND -r COMMAND_TO_REPLACE
```

* For example, if you like swapping between themes, you can enter `-al light -r theme -bg light`
* This results in `theme -bg light` being shortened to `light`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">
:exclamation: **Warning** <br>

**This feature is meant for advanced users, please be careful**

This feature is still in beta, note:
* Aliases **cannot** be deleted as of the current version
* Aliases must be for the entire command (i.e. cannot replace `add -n` with `addn`)
</div>


#### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

#### Saving the data

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Dook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it. 

Furthermore, certain edits can cause **Dook** to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
